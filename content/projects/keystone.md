KeystoneJS is an open sourced Headless CMS and platform for creating applications.

## Configurable

Configure a highly customised CMS and API in minutes.

## Extensible

Keystone achieves flexibility through small highly composable parts that allow you to build the foundation for any application.

## Open source

Keystone is open source with an MIT License that allows commercial reuse and modification. The codebase is [freely available on GitHub](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone-5).

## Zero assumptions

Keystone's extensible architecture means you choose the features you need. Pick an ideal starting point rather than working hard to adapt an opinionated platform.

## Fully featured

Zero assumptions doesn't mean zero features. Keystone comes with dozens of field types, access control, authentication and applications out of the box. Configure these, extend them or add your own features.

## Access control

Authentication and access control are important for many kinds of applications. With Keystone you can choose from an existing authentication provider or configure it to connect to your own.

Configure access controls on an entire list or individual fields. Allow access to different parts of your application including the graphQL API, admin interface, or other applications.

## Self host

Own your own data and host Keystone anywhere. Our example applications show some all-in-one deployment options with Heroku, but you are able to host your front-end application, database, Admin UI and API on

## Choose your storage methods

Keystone allows you to choose different storage methods for your data. Currently provided are adapters for MongoDB and Postgres, with additional adapters in development, including options for file-system storage such as JSON and cloud storage services such as AWS.

Field level adapters allow you to fetch or store data in different locations. Examples include uploading images to Cloudinary or fetching information from `o-embed` links.

## Get started

Despite the high level of configurability, most customisations are opt-in and Keystone provides sensible defaults to help you can get started quickly.

Keystone provide a range of example applications and CLI tools with sensible starting points for all kinds of applications.
